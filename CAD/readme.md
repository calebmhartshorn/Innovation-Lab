Assembly Instructions:

After all the parts have been printed using the given STLs the assembly proccess can begin

Step #1: Attach the screen to the mounting frame using the smaller bushings with a nylon nut and bolt.

Step #2: Connect the screen to the Raspberry Pi.

Step #3: Attach the camera to the mounting frame using the longer bushing with a nylon nut and bolt.

Step #4: Attach the camera cable adapter to the Raspberry Pi and the camera

Step #5: Ensure the SD card has been placed within the Raspberry Pi.

Step #6: Thread a screw through the back casing, the Raspberry Pi, and mounting frame and secure this with a nut. 

Step #7: Next, clip the buttons into there slot, located at the top of the back casing. 

Step #8: Wire these buttons into the Raspberry Pi.

Step #9: The printed buttons can then be glued onto these buttons.

Step #10: Place a nylon nut in each cut out in the front casing.

Step #11: Thread a screw through the back of the back casing into the nylon nut of the front casing to secure the whole product together.
